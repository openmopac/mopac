@article{Sparrow,
	abstract = {Semi-empirical quantum chemical approaches are known to compromise accuracy for the feasibility of calculations on huge molecules. However, the need for ultrafast calculations in interactive quantum mechanical studies, high-throughput virtual screening, and data-driven machine learning has shifted the emphasis toward calculation runtimes recently. This comes with new constraints for the software implementation as many fast calculations would suffer from a large overhead of the manual setup and other procedures that are comparatively fast when studying a single molecular structure, but which become prohibitively slow for high-throughput demands. In this work, we discuss the effect of various well-established semi-empirical approximations on calculation speed and relate this to data transfer rates from the raw-data source computer to the results of the visualization front end. For the former, we consider desktop computers, local high performance computing, and remote cloud services in order to elucidate the effect on interactive calculations, for web and cloud interfaces in local applications, and in world-wide interactive virtual sessions. The models discussed in this work have been implemented into our open-source software SCINE Sparrow.},

@article{CP2K,

It is especially aimed at massively parallel and linear-scaling electronic structure methods and state-of-the-art ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Excellent performance for electronic structure calculations is achieved using novel algorithms implemented for modern high-performance computing systems. This review revisits the main capabilities of CP2K to perform efficient and accurate electronic structure simulations. The emphasis is put on density functional theory and multiple post--Hartree--Fock methods using the Gaussian and plane wave approach and its augmented all-electron extension.},

@inbook{PDB,
	abstract = {The Protein Data Bank (PDB)----the single global repository of experimentally determined 3D structures of biological macromolecules and their complexes----was established in 1971, becoming the first open-access digital resource in the biological sciences. The PDB archive currently houses {\textasciitilde}130,000 entries (May 2017). It is managed by the Worldwide Protein Data Bank organization (wwPDB; wwpdb.org), which includes the RCSB Protein Data Bank (RCSB PDB; rcsb.org), the Protein Data Bank Japan (PDBj; pdbj.org), the Protein Data Bank in Europe (PDBe; pdbe.org), and BioMagResBank (BMRB; www.bmrb.wisc.edu). The four wwPDB partners operate a unified global software system that enforces community-agreed data standards and supports data Deposition, Biocuration, and Validation of {\textasciitilde}11,000 new PDB entries annually (deposit.wwpdb.org). The RCSB PDB currently acts as the archive keeper, ensuring disaster recovery of PDB data and coordinating weekly updates. wwPDB partners disseminate the same archival data from multiple FTP sites, while operating complementary websites that provide their own views of PDB data with selected value-added information and links to related data resources. At present, the PDB archives experimental data, associated metadata, and 3D-atomic level structural models derived from three well-established methods: crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), and electron microscopy (3DEM). wwPDB partners are working closely with experts in related experimental areas (small-angle scattering, chemical cross-linking/mass spectrometry, Forster energy resonance transfer or FRET, etc.) to establish a federation of data resources that will support sustainable archiving and validation of 3D structural models and experimental data derived from integrative or hybrid methods.},
